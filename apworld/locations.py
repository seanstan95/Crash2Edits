    # # In our case, the player must press a button in the top left room to open the final boss door.
    # # AP has something for this purpose: "Event locations" and "Event items".
    # # An event location is no different than a regular location, except it has the address "None".
    # # It is treated during generation like any other location, but then it is discarded.
    # # This location cannot be "sent" and its item cannot be "received", but the item can be used in logic rules.
    # # Since we are creating more locations and adding them to regions, we need to grab those regions again first.
    # top_left_room = world.get_region("Top Left Room")
    # final_boss_room = world.get_region("Final Boss Room")
    #
    # # One way to create an event is simply to use one of the normal methods of creating a location.
    # button_in_top_left_room = APQuestLocation(world.player, "Top Left Room Button", None, top_left_room)
    # top_left_room.locations.append(button_in_top_left_room)
    #
    # # We then need to put an event item onto the location.
    # # An event item is an item whose code is "None" (same as the event location's address),
    # # and whose classification is "progression". Item creation will be discussed more in items.py.
    # # Note: Usually, items are created in world.create_items(), which for us happens in items.py.
    # # However, when the location of an item is known ahead of time (as is the case with an event location/item pair),
    # # it is common practice to create the item when creating the location.
    # # Since locations also have to be finalized after world.create_regions(), which runs before world.create_items(),
    # # we'll create both the event location and the event item in our locations.py code.
    # button_item = items.APQuestItem("Top Left Room Button Pressed", ItemClassification.progression, None, world.player)
    # button_in_top_left_room.place_locked_item(button_item)
    #
    # # A way simpler way to do create an event location/item pair is by using the region.create_event helper.
    # # Luckily, we have another event we want to create: The Victory event.
    # # We will use this event to track whether the player can win the game.
    # # The Victory event is a completely optional abstraction - This will be discussed more in set_rules().
    # final_boss_room.add_event(
    #     "Final Boss Defeated", "Victory", location_type=APQuestLocation, item_type=items.APQuestItem
    # )
    #
    # # If you create all your regions and locations line-by-line like this,
    # # the length of your create_regions might get out of hand.
    # # Many worlds use more data-driven approaches using dataclasses or NamedTuples.
    # # However, it is worth understanding how the actual creation of regions and locations works,
    # # That way, we're not just mindlessly copy-pasting! :)
